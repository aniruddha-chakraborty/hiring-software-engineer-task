-- it's important to have UInt32, because during fraud detection, you need to add -minus clicks,impression or conversions operation here.
-- And you need event_time and event_minute be passed from from bidding server, reason is, Normally a line item can have an expiry date
-- So bidding service will serve campaign till clock hits 23:59, but pushing to kafka, clickhouse ingestion, running materlized view
-- costs time which can generate report bit later in the database which results in slight issue from technical end but from a report or
-- business perspective they will see campaign being served even after they wanted it stop.
